# GAN-For-CVD

These are the files which include code written for Infosys Springboard Internship GAN(General Adversarial Network) for CVD(Color Vision Deficiency).

These include the Google Colaboratory Notebooks as well as the datasets created.

There are essentially 3 datasets - Original Images Dataset, Simulated Dataset (how people with CVD see the pictures in the dataset), Recoloured Dataset (or the colour
compensated dataset, which is the dataset obtained after applying the colour compensation algorithm).
